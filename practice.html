    <p>This is a basic webpage that i[owen] is using to practice what i think is called
        programming i am writing this to run a test and see i have gained from what i learnt
        i'm note sure if it's difficult or not so i want to check if it is working.
    </p>
    <p>Secondly programming is actually fun to learn and also not that
        hard you just need to be practicing regulary so that the code/command can stick with you
        and i also want be a good programmer and reach javascript very soon.
    </p>
    <p>Lastly i cme to acedu coding bootcamp at ogba to learn programming because i am on long
        holiday and i just finished my junior waec and i just can't stay at home doing nothing
